# Anime Profile Card Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Running a Next.js app involves several steps. Next.js is a popular React framework for building server-rendered and statically-generated web applications. Here's a general guide on how to run a Next.js app:

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Navigate to App Directory:**
   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your Next.js app is located.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**
   To run your Next.js app in development mode, use the following command:
   
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access Your App:**
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your Next.js app in action.

That's it! These steps assume that you have already created your Next.js app and have the necessary files in place. You can now start working on your app and make changes as needed.
